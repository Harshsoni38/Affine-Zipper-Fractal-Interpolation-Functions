# Affine Zipper Fractal Interpolation Functions (FIFs)

## Overview
Affine Zipper Fractal Interpolation Functions (FIFs) combine a 'zipper' strategy with a binary signature and scaling functions to model complex datasets using Iterated Function Systems (IFS). This approach is particularly useful in applications such as:

- **Image Compression**
- **Signal Processing**
- **Computational Mechanics**
- **Physics Simulations**

By utilizing affine transformations and the zipper method, this project aims to improve fractal-based function approximations, including functions like the Weierstrass function.
